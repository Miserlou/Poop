# ðŸ’© Poop

**Poop** is an ad-blocker which blocks Google ads _and the pages that host them_.

The mission of the project is to leave the user with a _purely non-commercial_ web browsing experience.

## What?

The internet is completely smeared with poop. Low-quality, click-baity, designed-to-infuriate, ad-supported poop. I'm sick of it.

Ad-blockers do a great job of blocking ad units themselves, but nothing to block the shitty content which surrounds them. Poop aims to solve this problem.

## Development / Usage

The easiest way to try this out is to:

`npm install web-ext --global`

Then, from the `poop` directory:

`web-ext run`

Easy!
