# Poop 💩

''Poop'' is an ad-blocker which blocks Google ads _and the pages that host them_.

The mission of the project is to leave the user with a ''purely non-commercial'' internet browsing experience.

## What?

The internet is completely smeared with poop. Low-quality, click-baity, designed-to-infuriate, ad-supported poop. I'm sick of it.

## Development / Usage

The easiest way to try this out is to:

`npm install web-ext --global`

Then, from the `poop` directory:

`web-ext run`

Easy!
